Some tips when working with Figma design:
1. Shift+1 zoom to fit
2. We always want the image to be larger than it will be on the page, so that it can remains sharp.So when export the image, we can choose size 2x.
3. The image can be export with the format of PNG, it will allows us to maintain quality by exporting at a bigger size as well as maintaining transparency, which is especially important for those images that have box shadow.
